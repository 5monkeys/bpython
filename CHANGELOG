v0.3.2
======
Thanks to Aaron Gallagher for pointing out a case where the hugely
inefficient list generation routines were actually making a significant
issue; they're much more efficient now and should hopefully not cause
any more problems.

v0.3.1
======
Thanks to Klaus Alexander Seis for the expanduser() patch.
Auto indent works on multiple levels now.

v0.3.0
======
Now with auto-indent. Let me know if it's annoying.

v0.2.4
======
Thanks a lot to Angus Gibson for submitting a patch to fix a problem
I was having with initialising the keyboard stuff in curses properly.

Also a big thanks to John Beisley for providing the patch that shows
a class __init__ method's argspec on class instantiation.

I've fixed up the argspec display so it handles really long argspecs
(e.g. subprocess.Popen()) and doesn't crash if something horrible
happens (rather, it avoids letting something horrible happen).

I decided to add a key that will get rid of the autocomplete window,
since it can get in the way. C-l seemed like a good choice, since
it would work well as a side-effect of redrawing the screen (at 
least that makes sense to me). In so doing I also cleaned up a lot
of the reevaluating and resizing code so that a lot of the strange
output seen on Rewind/resize seems to be gone.

v0.2.3
======
The fix for the last bug broke the positioning of the autocomplete
box, whoops.

v0.2.2
======
That pesky bug keeps coming up. I think it's finally nailed but
it's just a matter of testing and hoping. I hate numbers.

v0.2.1
======
I'm having a bit of trouble with some integer division that's
causing trouble when a certain set of circumstances arise,
and I think I've taken care of that little bug, since it's
a real pain in the ass and only creeps up when I'm actually
doing something useful, so I'll test it for a bit and release
it as hopefully a bug fixed version.

v0.2.0
======
A little late in the day to start a changelog, but here goes...
This version fixed another annoying little bug that was causing
crashes given certain exact circumstances. I always find it's the
way with curses and sizing of windows and things...

I've also got bpython to try looking into pydoc if no matches
are found for the argspec, which means the builtins have argspecs
too now, hooray.
