.SH NAME
bpython \- a fancy curses interface to the Python interactive interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bpython
.I rc\-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The idea is to provide the user with all the features
in\-line, much like modern IDEs, but in a simple,
lightweight package that can be run in a terminal
window.

.B * In\-line syntax highlighting. (available with Pygments)
.RS
Hilights commands as you type!
.RE
.B * Readline\-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type.
.RS
Press tab to complete expressions when there's only one suggestion.
.RE
.B * Expected parameter list. (available with pyparsing)
.RS
This displays a list of parameters for any function you call. It uses the inspect module, then tries pydoc.
.RE
.B * Rewind.
.RS
This is a bit misleading, but it code that has been entered is remembered, and when you Rewind, it pops the last line and re\-evaluates the entire code. This is error\-prone, and mostly useful for defining classes and functions. 
.RE
.B * Pastebin code/write to file.
.RS
This posts the current buffer to a pastebin (rafb.net/paste for now) or writes it to a file.
.RE
.B * Flush curses screen to stdout.
.RS
Unlike other curses apps, it dumps the screen data to stdout when you quit, so you see what you've done in the buffer of your terminal.
.RE

.SH KEYS
.B <C\-d>
Exit
.RS
Exits the interpreter, like normal interactive Python.
.RE
.B <C\-r>
Rewind
.RS
Rewinds and "undoes" the last statement, read 
.B DESCRIPTION
for more info.
.RE
.B <F2>
Save
.RS
Saves the current buffer to a file.
.RE
.B <F8>
Pastebin
.RS
Posts the current buffer to 
.B http://rafb.net/paste
(will probably become configurable), and displays the URL.
.RE
.B <Tab>
Autocomplete
.RS
If there's an unambigious completion of the expression, fill it in.
.RE

.SH FILES
~/.bpythonrc
.RS
Your bpython config. See sample-rc (in /usr/share/docs/bpython/examples on Debian) for various options you can use, or read
.BR bpythonrc (5)
 .
.RE

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR bpythonrc (5),
.BR python (1).

.SH KNOWN BUGS
Triple quoted strings over multiple lines work, but they're not highlighted
properly.
