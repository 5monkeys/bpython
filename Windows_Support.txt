CLI Windows Support
===================

Dependencies
============
Curses
    Use the appropriate version compiled by Christoph Gohlke
    http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

pyreadline
    Use the version in the cheeseshop
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline/
    
Recommended
===========
Obtain the less program from GnuUtils. This makes the pager work as intended.
It can be obtained from cygwin or GnuWin32 or msys
    
Current version is tested with
------------------------------
Curses 2.2
pyreadline 1.7

Curses Notes
============
The curses used has a bug where the colours are displayed incorrectly:
    red  is swapped with blue
    cyan is swapped with yellow

To correct this I have provided my windows.theme file.

This curses implementation has 16 colors (dark and light versions of the colours)
